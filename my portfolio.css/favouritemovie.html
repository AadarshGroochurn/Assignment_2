        <P>KGF is an amazing indian film,this film is like an history this film is mostly about power
            if you get power over someting no one can defeat you.This film inspire me how to become rich,
            when the men was a kid he had nothing,no food,no clothes and no money even that he was strong in his mind.
            when he was kid he promis her mom that when he willl die he will be the richest guy on earth.
            He kept his promis and he also die with all his money.
