    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned,
         about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</p>
         <h3>step 2</h3>
         <p>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger;
          cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder,
           pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</p>
           <h3>step 3</h3>
           <p>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat,
             stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a
              little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</p>
              <h3>step 4</h3>
              <p>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender,
                 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking.
                  If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</p>
                  <h3>step 5</h3>
                  <p>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.</p>
                  <h3>step 6</h3>
                  <p>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves,
                     cinnamon stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</p>
                     <h3>step 7</h3>
                     <p>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well.</p>
                     <h3>step 8</h3>
                     <p>Add chicken mixture and potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</p>
                     <h3>step 9</h3>
                     <p>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes 
                        without lifting the lid or stirring.</p>
                        <h3>step 10</h3>
                        <p>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</p>
